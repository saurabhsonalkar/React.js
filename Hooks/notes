******************* Hooks *******************

1. useState

- let i = 0; i++;
  This will not working in react because the issue is that the local variable i is not part of React's state. React components re-render only when state or props change. Since i is a regular variable, updating it won't trigger a re-render. 

- useState hook is a react feature that allows you to add state to a functional component.

- Think of state as a way to store and manage data that can change over time and affect what the component displays.

- syntax: const[state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
- state: The current value of the state variable.
- setState: A function to update the state.
- initialValue: The initial value of the state when the component  renders for the first time.

- Whenever you call setState, React automatically re-renders the component so that the UI updates to match the new state.

- State updates are asynchronous,meaning react batches multiple updates for performance.

- use: create interactiveand dynamic components like forms, counters,and toggle buttons.

- React automaytically handles the connection between the state and UI, so you don't need to manually update the DOM.
